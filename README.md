# SlackWebhook
SlackWebhook lets you send all the events for specified devices to a [Slack Incoming Webhook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks). 
Just add the code as a SmartApp, select the devices you want events for and put in the Slack Incoming Webhook URL.
It's based on [Harper Reed's](http://twitter.com/harper) [SmartThings-Webhook](https://github.com/harperreed/SmartThings-webhook).
